<p><font color="white" face="Bookman old style" size="5">The thing I like to play the best is basketball. I like basketball because its fun sport to play and good way to get a long to with other people. When I have problem with my studies I want to play basketball because its helps me to forgot it for a moment. To me basketball gets you closer to the other people and their interest. Like to say you are playing with or against someone you don't know and you start to play them. You get to know how they play and you start talking to get to know them more, and what their personality is like. To some people basketball is boring sport, but I think they have that idea because they don't understand what is going on and how the sport is played.</font></p>
